Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that uses MySQL. This app will take in orders from customers and delete store's inventory as needed. 

* Run application by running node bamazonCustomer.js in terminal. 

* The application will display a list of inventory that are available for sale as well as the price and quantity. 

* The prompt will ask customer for the product ID they would like to buy & how many unite they would like to buy. 

* Once the customer place the order, the log will show total pricing and an updated inventory list. 

* If the customer enters an ID that is not in the inventory, an error will pop up. Entering an invalid quantity will also prompt an error.
